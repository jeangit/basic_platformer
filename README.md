# Basic platformer with LÃ¶ve2D
## Purpose
It's just for implementing deadly boring things, but please, have a look.


## Running !

### Arch and on-the-edge distributions :thumbsup:
`pacman -S love`
 _(or equivalent)_

`cd ~/sources/alien/platformer/ && love .`
_(yihaaa !)_

### You are on Debian :scream:
- [ ] You can use the source and compile it.
- [ ] You can use the (still buggy) AppImage provided on the love mainsite
- [ ] You can browse [pre-built repository](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/) for a love binary in `.tar.gz` archive.
